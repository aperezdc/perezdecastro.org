Title: Maintaining your LVM snapshots clean

As [I have written before][] snapshots is a extremely fast and
convenient way of perfoming *live* backups which can be mounted and
handled like any other filesystem. But I also told you that LVM snaphots
could render themselves as unusable when they run out of free blocks.
Today I hacked up a quick script which automagically increments sizes of
snapshots logical volumes. Just drop the following snippet into
`/etc/cron.hourly` and relax:

```bash
#! /bin/bash

THRESHOLD="80"
INCREMENT="15"

set -e
IFS=':'

/sbin/lvs --noheadings --units M --separator : |   
while read lv vg attr lsize origin snapp move log copyp
do
  # Check whether this is a snapshot or not
  [ "${snapp}" ] || continue

  snapp=${snapp%.*}
  lv=${lv// /}

  # Check whether the thing needs resizing
  [ "${snapp}" -ge "${THRESHOLD}" ] || continue

  lsize=${lsize%.*}
  isize=$(( INCREMENT * lsize / 100 ))
  echo "lvresize -L +${isize}M ${vg}/${lv}"
  /sbin/lvresize -L "+${isize}M" "${vg}/${lv}"
done
```

You can change the following settings:

- `THRESHOLD` is the percent of usage which triggers resizing. When
  actual usage is greater than this value snapshots will grow.
- `INCREMENT` is used to calculate how much size is added to the
  volume, it is a percent of the current volume size.

Of course the script could be improved (i.e. it could check whether
there are space for growing in the volume group), but this na√Øve
implementation is enough to make me happy and not to worry about
checking status of my snapshots periodically :D
