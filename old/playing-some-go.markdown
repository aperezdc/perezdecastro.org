So the other day I wanted to play some Go, but not the kind of Go you
could imagine by looking at today's post picture:

I mean the Google's [Go programming language][]. The sad news Â is that
there are no Debian packages in the repositories, but I was able of
finding [a Mercurial repository][] with the stuff needed to make build a
nice build of it. So if you want to try out Go, just add the [Igalia APT
repository][] to your system and install `google-go`. For the lazy
people, this just cast this magic spell:

```bash
wget -qO- http://apt.igalia.com/apt-igalia.key | apt-key add -
deb http://apt.igalia.com igalia main
apt-get install google-go
```

For the moment there is an `amd64` for Sid that should work fine on
Ubuntu (Lucid and Maverick). I tried making an ARM build, but it failed
with some error I did not try to fix (yet).

Have a lot of fun playing with Go!
