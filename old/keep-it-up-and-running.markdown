Yesterday I found [The Admin Zen][]. Recommended reading for all the
systems administrators out there. I liked the fact that some of the
principles are loosely based on *The Zen of Python*, which you can read
by just typing the following in a console:

```bash
python -c 'import this'
```

Enjoy... and keep your stuff up and running.
