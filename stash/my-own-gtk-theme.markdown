I have never been completely happy with how the widgets of Gtk+
applications looked like. Undoubtedly the “Clearlooks” theme was an
impressive improvement, but it has some glitches with some applications
(for example [Claws-Mail][] [has to be tamed][] to look good with some
themes) and I always had the curiosity of knowing how a theme is made.
So I picked up the [Chrome][] theme which uses the [Murrine][] engine,
and modified it to have warm gray colors, and the Gnome panel with the
same shades as the rest of the widgets. After some tweaking I came up
with this:

[![][]][]

It makes a smooth, clean environment without too much distractions,
apart from the blue shades of the selected items, so it is a good option
for everyday use. Especially if you spend loads of hours in front of a
computer. It matches nicely with the “Clearlooks” theme included in the
latest versions of the [OpenBox][] window manager (which I use).

I think this is nice enough to share, so you may want to [get the theme
conveniently packaged as a tarball][].
