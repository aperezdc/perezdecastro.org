So it is September the 19th aboard, meaning yer should be [talkin' like
pirates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day)...
because [yer truly FSM
mandates](http://www.venganza.org/2006/09/19/talk-like-a-pirate-day/)
so. For those of yer who would wavin' yer cutlasses for new Monkey
Island stuff, some folks have smartly made readily available a [free
copy of Tales of Monkey
Island](http://www.telltalegames.com/playlikeapirate/) for yer surfin'
buccaneers!

Some bad news: yer will be needin' Windows. Dunno what that's mean,
folk, but sound like no good, arrrrr!
