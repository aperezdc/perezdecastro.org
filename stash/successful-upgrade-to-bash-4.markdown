Yesterday my package manager insisted in updating Bash to version 4,
which [was released some time ago][]. I was a bit worried because as
this new version intruduced [new features][], just in casethey could
cause some of my working scripts to fail miserably. The fact is that
finally I decided to bump to the new version, as I have not heard
nothing about painful upgrades (as happened in the 2-to-3 transition).
After installing it everything continues to work nicely with version
4.0... and I can try out the new cool features (hash tables are one of
my favourites!).
