Now, this is funny... I have joined the same group at
[Last.fm](http://last.fm) two times. Twice? Sure! This is actually a
real screenshot of my sidebar:

I must admit that I was in using a GSM modem, and network latency was
high, so I clicked the “Join” button twice. But never thought that the
website would take my orders so rigurously.

Maybe I should try asking for a nice girl... Maybe I can get twins, haha
:-D
