These are the authentic and unique Lightsabers™ which were used in the
Star Wars films, and they can be purchased right here in Corunna! Just
go for a walk by the Royal St. («Calle Real») and get your own now as
christmas gift :-P

Everybody wants one of those... May the force be with you.

***Standard disclaimer:** Only the photo is real; any other similarities

relation of any kind with George Lucas, LucasFilm™, The Force Corp. or
