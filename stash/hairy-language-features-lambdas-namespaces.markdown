There are some (mis)features which always make me wonder wheter certain
programming languages are really *that* good. This is the first of a
series of posts about computer languages and their particularities.
Expect some rants, some praises and a degree of irony. Well, some of the
notes can be instructing as well,

One of the languages which always makes me feel dirty is [PHP][]. For
example, they say that PHP does not need [namespaces][], because they
can just [add prefixes][]. And code ends up with names like
[Mage\_Catalog\_Model\_Resource\_Eav\_Mysql4\_Product\_Type\_Configurable\_Attribute\_Collection][].

Java™ has ~~the same~~ a similar problem... but I will talk about it in
a future installment.

  [PHP]: http://php.net
  [namespaces]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace

  [Mage\_Catalog\_Model\_Resource\_Eav\_Mysql4\_Product\_Type\_Configurable\_Attribute\_Collection]:
