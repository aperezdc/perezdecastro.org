![Emphasis](http://hario.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/emphasis.png)Lately
I have been using the great [Music Player
Daemon](http://www.musicpd.org) (or, in short, MPD) for playback,
because I really find useful having it on the background and being able
of using it from any imaginable interface: command line ("mpc"), text
interface (the curses based "ncmpc") and a large array of graphical
interfaces... there are even [some](http://www.pixelhum.com/neompc/)
[web-based](http://mroyer31.hd.free.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php)
[interfaces](http://musicpd.org/phpMp2.shtml) which I did not try yet.
And if you start MPD from your initscripts, you can even start listening
to music before logging in to your system!

Yesterday I tried a new MPD frontend called
[Emphasis,](http://emphasis.tuxfamily.org/) which is built around
[ETK](http://www.enlightenment.org/), a widget toolkit which uses rest
of the EFL. It blends greatly with the rest of Enlightenment 0.17 and
has an impressive look... much nicer than the other GTK+ frontends I
tried.

The only drawback is that the player is in its early stages of
development and there are missing features everywhere. But at least the
things I use regularly (the status window with controls and the album
art, as seen on the screenshot) work smoothly right now.

So get your hands on the keyboard and, if you use Gentoo, just "emerge"
your copy of Emphasis, you will find it in the [MPD
overlay](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Repositories#Experimental_Gentoo_Overlay).
Merry Christmas!
