![Hario](http://hario.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/hario-128.jpg)You may
wonder from where does my nickname, Hario (はりお), comes from: [Harima
Kenji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harima_Kenji), a character from the
anime series [School Rumble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Rumble)
signs his manga comics as Harima Hario, and it is also how Anegasaki
calls him. I really wanted to use Hige (鬚, "beard"), which is his other
nickname because during the first season of the series he sports a
promiment beard —which eventually gets shaved— like me. But that user
name was already in use by someone else.

*No* (の) is japanese for posessives, and it is written after the owner
of something, and *kai*(階) means "story" or "stories", so you are
reading *Hario's stories* (はりおの階).

Have a lot of fun...

P.S. Of course, here's my [contact information,](/contact/) just in case
you want to drop me a message ;-)
