I am right now trying to add support for writing files in
[reStructuredText][] format to the [blogpost][] tool. In fact, if you
can see this post *nicely formatted*, I would be that the thing has
worked and I will be posting the patch anytime soonâ„¢...

Stay tuned ;-)

**Update:** grab the patch [here][]
