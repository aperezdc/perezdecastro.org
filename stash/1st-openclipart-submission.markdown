Today I contributed to [OpenClipart](http://openclipart.org) for first
time. The drawing is a vectorized version of «Tori», the bird which
represents Akira Toriyama in popular Dr. Slump anime series. It looks
like the following image (the SVG is nicer, indeed):

I hope you will like it ;-)

**Edit:** The OpenClipart people said the character might be
copyrighted, so I removed the SVG from their website. If someone want
the SVG file, just [drop me an email](/contact/). The next time I use
the great [InkScape](http://www.inkscape.org) for something new I'll
contribute the image to OpenClipart, of course!
