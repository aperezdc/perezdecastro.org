![Giggle Graph][]

The image at the left is exactly what [Giggle][] shows in this very
precise moment for one of my coding projects. I think this is the most
complex commit graph I have seen during my occassional coding
tasks...Â <span style="background-color: #ffffff">This is how [Git][] is
supposed to be used: a branch per feature, and small atomic commits.
Definitely I like this way of working :D</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff">(This post is no more a small
coding break... just to leave some neurons rest before reclaiming them
back :D)</span>
