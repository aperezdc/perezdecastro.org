It's been a long time since I posted an update, and as I am going to
[FOSDEM][] this year for first time, it looks like now is a good moment
to tell everybody that I am still alive and kicking. Similarly to
[some][] [other][] [work][] [mates][], [Igalia][] is sponsoring my trip
to Brussels. A [lot][] [of us][] will be there, so it will be a great
opportunity to meet some of them I have not seen for some time and have
a [beer][] or [two][] (or more :-D).

On another different note, an update for those reading this who are
wondering what happened to me in the last three months: I have been
since the last October in Finland, enjoying the snow, going rock'n'roll
concerts ([and][] [discovering][] [great][] [bands][]), writing now more
code than prose...

I hope to come back to blog anytime soon, as I have been playing with
[QtSparql][] lately to access the [Tracker][] store and I have a
half-baked post with some tips on how to use it for “live” [models][]
that are automatically updated.

Anyway, see you at FOSDEM!
