A couple of weekends ago I attended [FOSDEM][], my third time in a row
sponsored by [Igalia][].

Apart from the appeal of wandering around Brussels and enjoying what the
European capital has to offer —mostly in the gastronomic field—, this
year I had a presentation to make about the [progress done in WebKitGTK+
during the last year][]. Because it was The room was quite full, so for
those who could not make it on time or decided to not step in, here are
the slides I used:

-   [HTML slides][]: you will need a quite recent browser, WebKit-based
    if possible. The latest version of ~~Epiphany~~ [the GNOME Web
    browser][] will do fine ;-)
-   [PDF slides][]: Essentially the same, generated from the HTML plus
    some `pdfutils` mojo to crop the margins. Any reasonable PDF viewer
    should handle those well.

Those should be a good summary while the [videos of the “crossdistro”
room slowly start to appear][] thanks to the good work done by the video
team.

Last but not least, in the middle of the huge amount of interesting
talks, [there were two more Igalians with talks][] at FOSDEM: [Felipe][]
had a [talk about user experience design][] and [API][] made a summary
on [how accessibility in GNOME got to be enabled by default][].

There is only one small “complaint” I have about FOSDEM: would there
ever be enough time to attend all the sessions one would like to? I bet
not. And that is, in a way, quite amazing :-)
