Time has passed since the latest time I blogged about something, and
some things have happened, so I think it is a good occasion to write
some words.

The first news is that I have just released [Bill][] 0.2, which
introduces the following changes:

-   Change license to the new [GPLv3][].
-   Modules have now a `.bash` suffix instead of `.bsh`
-   Compatibility fixes, so it now works better with Bash 3.1
-   Better handling of comment lines and nicer error handler in the
    `text/config` module.
-   Some other minor bug fixes.
-   New modules: [twiki/ext][], [text/bte][], [data/time][],
    [text/log][]

Last but not least, as [my colleagues][] are saying (e.g. [Mario][],
[Joaquim][], [Javier M.][], [Sergio][]) in their latest posts, we had a
very nice inauguration party at our brand new office. I think they have
already written what needs to be said, so I will only add that I think
that it worths having some inconveniences (as we had!) during the switch
from one office to another. Everyone did a good job to get everything in
place. Congrats!

I hope to start blogging again regularly. I have some ideas pending to
be written, now the problem is to find some spare time slots to expand
them :-)
