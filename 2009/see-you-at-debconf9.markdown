I will pick up my car and embark myself into a
8-hour trip to reach Cáceres tomorrow in the evening, after 699 km of
road trip. The goal: attending (and enjoying!) the [ninth edition of the
Debian Conference][], which has already started. As I do not know
exactly the arrival time, I will skip the dinner tomorrow, but I will do
my best to be at the [Cheese & wine party][] and bringing some “tetilla”
(small breast) cheese from Galicia, which has a funny shape as you can
imagine:

I am looking forward to be there tomorrow, as this will be my first time
at a big community event and it really looks like [this][] [kind][]
[of][] [things][] are really interesting and a great opportunity to get
in touch with latest developments, learning lots of new stuff, and
meeting people from all around the world... The latter is a *must* for
me, as I will not know anyone there because there will be no more
[Igalians][] attending the conference. So if you will be there from 25th
to 30th feel free to approach me and have some chat.

Last, but not least, shell scripters (and anyone interested) may want to
know that have a [slot in the unofficial][] track for a  lecture on
Shaft, a tool which we have been using lately to do declarative unit
testing of shell scripts. I am just now polishing the slides, preparing
a couple of examples and preparing the code for release.

See you there!
