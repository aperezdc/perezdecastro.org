I have just relased version `0.1-2` of [Bill][], your favourite
accompaniment for your shell-code meals. Albeit I have plans for an
upcoming `0.2` which will break some backwards compatibility, this is a
just a mainteinance release which introduces some bugfixes. Quick
summary follows:

-   Better test suite and fixes for the `data/hash` module
-   Fix bug which prevented serving content from a non-default Billet
-   Allow for manually setting the server name in `billetd`
-   New `config_ini_get_chained` function in module `text/config`
-   The `butt` utility now accepts file names as arguments, so you can
    choose which unit tests to run, instead of waiting for the full lot
    to finish
-   Speed improvements when decoding MIME data in module `text/mime`

Last, but not least, some polish was applied to the documentation and
code style, and autogenerated files (i.e. HTML documentation) was
removed from the [GIT repository][].

And now, go and [get some packages][] ;)

Enjoy!
