I arrived yesterday at the main venue after a the long trip by car:
\~700km in a car *without* air conditioning. I was very tired so I
headed up for my room (which is in an ancient building at the [old town
area of Cáceres][]), had a shower and decided to take a nap... with so
much success that I slept for two hours and a miracle made me wake up
just in time for the [Cheese & wine party][]. It was great to taste an
uncountable amount of kinds of cheese, wine and liquors from places all
around the world. Among a lot of tasty stuff, it was really enlightening
to try out some *real* japanese [sake][] and [the best peanuts I ever
tried][].

After a quick breakfast today in the morning, my personal schedule
included attending the following:

-   [Using FOSSology for license analysis in Debian][]: a [tool][] which
    determines which license a package has by examining its sources and
    looking for license disclaimers and similar texts contained in
    source code was presented. This way even cases where each source
    file may have a different license can be easily identified. For
    packagers this makes easier to check whether a software component
    complies with the packaging policy.
-   [Not your grandpa's debhelper][]: This one really catched my
    attention, as I do some packaging from time to time it is very
    interesting to know about new incarnations of tools which suppose an
    aid to this task. The new `dh` thing is able of [greatly
    simplifying][] build rules. I wanna try it!
-   [Debian System Administraors BoF][]: I thought that it could be
    interesting to know how systems used for running the Debian
    infrastructure are configured. Three of the members of the team
    asked lots of questions from the audience, most of them being about
    e-mail services and whether it would be possible to improve spam
    handling.
-   [Scratchbox2 for cross-compiling Debian][]: It was a shame that
    there was no projector nor something similar for Riku to give an
    introduction to [Scratchbox 2][], which looks like a good step
    forward. For example now it is possible to use it without `root`
    privileges at all.
-   [Point releases - How to update stable more efficiently][]: I have
    missed some bits of this lecture because I was sitting near the end
    of the room, but if I understood correctly there is a plan for
    rolling updates sooner into the Debian stable package set by using a
    repository in the fashion of the Ubuntu “proposed-updates” one, so
    users can get theirs hands on sooner on the packages in order to
    provide the needed feedback for stabilization.

After having a light dinner I went along with [Diego][] for a walk along
the old town area, to see how does it look at night. The perfect
accompaniment was a glass of beer and ice cream.
