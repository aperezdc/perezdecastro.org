Recent versions of [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org) include support for ARM
devices based on the [Marvell
Kirkwood](http://www.marvell.com/embedded-processors/kirkwood/) platform,
included —but not limited to— the
[GuruPlug](https://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-guruplugdetails.aspx)
and the
[DreamPlug](https://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-dreamplugdetails.aspx).
I own one of each, and it was only a matter of time before I would try and
run NetBSD in one of them.


## The challenge

My computers I have at home are running GNU/Linux only at the moment. It
made me feel lazy

## 

Pick the sets from FTP

Partition a USB thumb drive with a small FAT partition, a BSD partition, and edit
the disklabel
