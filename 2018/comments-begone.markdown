Starting today, the comments section is not available any more in the articles
at the [perezdecastro.org](https://perezdecastro.org) website. The main reason
for for taking this decision is that I have never felt particularly comfortable
leaving that to a third party service. I have had in mind to provide a
self-hosted solution, which never materialized; and given the
little amount of comments posted in the last years, it seemed to me that
removing the comments section altogether would be the best course of action.

This means that now there is **absolutely nothing** in the website which could
potentially track visitors. This is a small contribution against [surveillance
capitalism](https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/)
that I have been wanting to do for a while.

The only information stored are the usual [HTTP server
logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_log); which contain the IP
addresses of visitors and the URLs they fetch from the server. Because I do
my own hosting I know for a fact that this data is not used for anything
other than troubleshooting, and only a few months of it are kept. Also,
IP addresses are anyway “public” information in the sense that any server
we connect to gets to know it, and that is part of how the Internet works.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy the ad- and tracker-free experience!

remaining bit, is gone now that I am self-hosting the Web fonts as well.
