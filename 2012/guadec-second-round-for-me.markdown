Last summer I had the opportunity of attending the [Desktop Summit][] in
Berlin, and being it a great experience I was more than looking forward
to attend [GUADEC][] this year. Not just because it is going to be great
to meet fellow hackers and friends after one year and attend the
sessions, but also because it is taking place in A Coru√±a, where I lived
for a decade. Last, but not least, there will be a GNOME OS hackfest on
July 30th (check it out in the [BoF/hackfests programme][]) and lately
that has been something which [has been in my list of interests][].

See you there!
