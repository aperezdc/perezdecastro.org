This year I will be attending [FOSDEM][] for the second time, and I am
really looking forward to it. Not only because my flight from Helsinki
this year will allow me to arrive on time for the [beer event][], but
because it is a great event that fosters the Libre Software / Open
Source community, it is packed with loads of interesting talks and
people have the possibility to get in direct touch with each other in
good atmosphere.

Once again, I am glad to be part of an Ã¼ber-cool company like
[Igalia][], which is sponsoring my trip to Brussels. See you all there!
